# Cursor Rules for Calendar Event Creation

## iCloud Calendar Timing Best Practices

### Issue: Calendar Event Time Zone and Date Calculation Quirks

**Problem:** When creating calendar events in iCloud Calendar via AppleScript, using relative time calculations like `(current date) + (2 * days) + (9 * hours)` can result in incorrect event timing due to:

- Current time being added to the calculation
- Time zone interpretation issues
- Daylight saving time complications

**Solution:** Always use explicit date and time format when creating calendar events.

### Correct AppleScript Date Format for iCloud Calendar Events:

```applescript
# ✅ CORRECT - Use explicit date format
osascript -e 'tell application "Calendar" to tell calendar "Calendar Name" to make new event with properties {summary:"Event Title", start date:date "DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS", end date:date "DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS"}'

# ❌ INCORRECT - Avoid relative time calculations
osascript -e 'tell application "Calendar" to tell calendar "Calendar Name" to make new event with properties {summary:"Event Title", start date:(current date) + (X * days) + (Y * hours), end date:(current date) + (X * days) + (Z * hours)}'
```

### Date Format Standards:

- Use DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format (e.g., "31/05/2025 09:00:00")
- Times are interpreted in the system's local timezone
- Always verify the created event shows the correct date and time

### Verification Command:

After creating an event, always verify with:

```applescript
osascript -e 'tell application "Calendar" to tell calendar "Calendar Name" to get {summary, start date, end date, location} of (first event whose summary is "Event Title")'
```

### Example Working Implementation:

```applescript
# Create event for Saturday, May 31, 2025, 9:00-10:00 AM
osascript -e 'tell application "Calendar" to tell calendar "Ben & Lore" to make new event with properties {summary:"Park Run Bishops park", start date:date "31/05/2025 09:00:00", end date:date "31/05/2025 10:00:00"}'

# Add location
osascript -e 'tell application "Calendar" to tell calendar "Ben & Lore" to set location of (first event whose summary is "Park Run Bishops park") to "Bishops Park"'
```

### Key Takeaways:

1. Always use explicit date/time strings, never relative calculations
2. Verify created events immediately after creation
3. Format: DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS
4. Test with different time zones if working across regions
5. Consider daylight saving time transitions when scheduling future events
