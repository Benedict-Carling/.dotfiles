# Dotfiles Repository Context

This is a **macOS dotfiles repository** for bootstrapping development environments. Here's what you need to know:

## Repository Purpose

- **Main Goal**: Automate macOS development setup with version managers, shell configuration, and development tools
- **Target**: macOS developers who want a reproducible development environment
- **Key Features**: Version management (Node.js via nvm, Python via pyenv), shell enhancement (Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k), and automated package installation (Homebrew)

## Git Submodules Structure

This repository heavily uses **git submodules** for external dependencies:

- `nvm/` - Node Version Manager for Node.js versions
- `ohmyzsh/` - Oh My Zsh framework for zsh enhancement
- `powerlevel10k/` - Fast zsh theme with git integration
- `pyenv/` - Python version management
- `zsh-autosuggestions/` - Fish-like command suggestions
- `zsh-syntax-highlighting/` - Syntax highlighting for zsh

## Core Configuration Files

- `.zshrc` - Main shell configuration
- `.gitconfig` - Git global settings
- `.p10k.zsh` - Powerlevel10k theme configuration
- `Brewfile` - Homebrew packages for automated installation

## Cursor IDE Optimization

- **Indexed**: Core dotfiles, configs, documentation
- **Excluded**: Submodules, binaries, caches (via .cursorignore)
- **Reason**: Keeps AI assistance fast by focusing on actual configuration rather than external dependencies

## When helping with this repository:

1. Focus on dotfiles configuration and setup scripts
2. Understand that submodules are external dependencies, not custom code
3. Consider macOS-specific requirements and Homebrew integration
4. Remember this is for development environment automation, not application development
